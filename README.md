general projects that I'm working on

# EF Tester
Testing the viability of Enity Framework to process large sets of data in memory and create flat index files for ingestion into applications.

## Use
Change the connection string in both projects to point to a supported database framework.  Within the CcsEfDll class, there's a variable that points to the mappings.json config file that must be correct.
